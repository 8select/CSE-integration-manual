# Product Export

In order to be able to display the products in the widgets in a meaningful way, a basic set of data must be transmitted.

In order to access the [Fashion Content Pool](../produktdaten-uebermitteln/fashion-content-pool/), we need certain product properties so that our system can normalise the data and enrich the products with further properties.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the section [**PRODUCT EXPORT**](../produktdaten-uebermitteln/daten-uebertragung.md) the requirements and possibilities of data transfer are described in detail.
