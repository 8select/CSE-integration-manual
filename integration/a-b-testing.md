# A/B Testing

Like us, many clients also follow the approach of "Data Driven Development". A/B tests are essential for this.   
In order for our platform to be able to generate reliable KPIs, it is important that widgets used in an A/B test are not simply hidden \(**display:none**\), but are not integrated in the DOM at all. 

This is not always so easy to do, but it is essential to get a reliable data basis. Just contact us and we will find a solution together!
