# üó∫ Internationalization

All our widgets have some static text elements. Those elements are fully configurable like the rest of the layout.

We can dynamically change the language of those elements based on the language the shop is currently using.&#x20;

As of now there is no way to configure the language the SDK should use, but it is on our roadmap.

For now our team will add custom code to your tenant's configuration to match the widget language to the shop language. Just reach out to your account manager!

{% hint style="info" %}
The 8SELECT integration team will adjust the widget texts for all languages your shop supports. ‚ù§Ô∏è&#x20;
