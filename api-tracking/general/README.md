description: Tracking for 8.API
---

# General

In order to support commission based pricing and enable insights about user behaviour with our content you have to send some analytics events. For our ready to use widgets this is done automatically. If you use 8.API and create your own UI those events have to be sent by your UI.

{% hint style="info" %}
Implementing this tracking is only necessary if you use 8.API and create your own UIs to present our content.

If you use widgets you do not need this!
{% endhint %}
