# Demo-Mode

If you have added the 8.SDK and widgets to your shop you can test the integration before the product export is working and content is delivered. To activate the demo mode there are two options:

* URL parameter `8S-demo=true`
* set `window._eightselect_config = { isDemoMode: true }`

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently only the widget `8.SET-Compose` supports the demo mode.
{% endhint %}
