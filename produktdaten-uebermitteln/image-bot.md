# Image Bot

We use the product images not only in our widgets but also to enrich the product data via image recognition. To do this, it is necessary to download the product images.

We do this via our image bot.

To ensure a smooth operation of the 8.HX, our image bot must have access to the product images.

The image bot uses the following user agent:

```http
8SELECT-imagebot/1.0 (+https://www.8select.com/bot)
```

The origin IP is not fixed. If it helps here is the [possible IP range](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html).
