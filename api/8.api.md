# 8.API \(Alpha\)

{% hint style="info" %}
8.API is currently in an early alpha phase. If you are interested, please speak to your account manager.
{% endhint %}

We have stopped working on the REST API and will implement the API directly with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

8.API should be able to be used by the most diverse clients. Whether web desktop, web mobile, app, email, affiliate marketing or one of the countless other possibilities. All use cases have different requirements for the API. Very different amounts of returned data are needed. In one case the product ID is enough in another case prices, stock, brand, colour etc. are also needed. This flexibility can also be achieved with a REST API, but it is much easier to map this with a GraphQL API.

{% hint style="success" %}
You will find updated preliminary documentation on our new GraphQL API here at the end of January 2021.
