# 1.0.1

## Fixed Bugs

### An empty result is now empty, before it contained an edge with `null` values

The `productSets()` query result would previously always include at least one —\
potentially empty — node. This caused unintended and confusing behaviour when\
an empty list would have been expected, e.g. there are no sets for the given\
product or the given product does not exist.

**Example**

```
query MyQuery {
  productSets(input: {queryType: SKU, value: "<non-existent-product-sku>"}) {
    edges {
      node {
        title
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**8.API 1.0.0 had returned**

```
{
  "data": {
    "productSets": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "title": null
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**8.API 1.0.1 returns**

```
{
  "data": {
    "productSets": {
      "edges": []
    }
  }
}
```
