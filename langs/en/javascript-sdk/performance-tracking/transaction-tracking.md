# Transaction-Tracking

To enable 8select-CSE sales tracking you have to integrate a second JavaScript code snippet. The sales tracking has to be implemented on the page that is displayed after a successful checkout.

The code snippet needs to be placed in the HTML anywhere after the code of the 8select-CSE JavaScript-SDK.

**WARNING** - Prices have to be defined in cents - so `199,95 â‚¬` has to be defined as `19995`.

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
  window.eightlytics(
    'purchase',
      {
        customerid: '1234',
        orderid: '1234',
        products: [
          {
            sku: '12345',
            amount: 3,
            price: 1199
          },
          {
            sku: '456',
            amount: 1,
            price: 19995
          }
        ]
    }  
  );
</script>
```
