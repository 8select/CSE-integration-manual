* SYS-ACC Widget - to display additional product suggestions for a SKU placed in the cart
* PSP-PSV Widget - to display a specific product set
* PSP-TLV Widget - to display a list of product sets
* ELTX-Client - for CSE performance tracking

The SDK and widgets work on desktop and mobile web browsers.

## Product-Export

Prerequisite for filling the widgets with content is the delivery of the online shop product data to a standard interface provided by 8select. Product data have to be uploaded regularly in an appropriate CSV format on an AWS S3 bucket provided by 8select.
