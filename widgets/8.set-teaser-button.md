# 8.SET Teaser Button

![8.SET Teaser Button below product image](https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LHKqRZhVzu1H_Op1cBA%2F-MB3TOnNIeLn4olCr116%2F-MB3W74RJF0relk3TvuN%2F8.SET%20Teaser%20Button%20example.png?alt=media&token=b00f3153-e9d1-495f-91a5-f8dd0d1a8b46)

## Widget-Element <a id="widget-element"></a>

```markup
<div data-8select-widget-id="sys-button"></div>
```

The element must not be styled in any way. Initially the widget is invisible because it is just an empty `div`. The contents and styling will be injected via 8.SDK.  
  
The contents and styling will be adjusted by the 8SELECT integration team.

{% hint style="danger" %}
The 8.SET Teaser Button will only work in combination with 8.SET Compose!  
The button will be shown as soon as there is an 8.SET Compose Widget that also has 8SELECT content, e.g. a fashion outfit for the current product. If there is no content for the current product, the 8.SET Teaser Button will not be visible.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The 8SELECT integration team will adjust the widget styling üé® to your shop design. ‚ù§Ô∏è
