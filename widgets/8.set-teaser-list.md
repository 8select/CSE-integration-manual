# 8.SET Teaser List

The widget does not allow interaction like 8.SET Compose. Instead, when an item is clicked, the customer is directed to the corresponding product.

```markup
<div data-8select-widget-id="psp-tlv" data-tags="homeoffice,smart-casual"></div>
```

* `data-tags` is a static attribute
  * 8.HX will load the product sets matching the given tags
  * you can find the tags in 8.CONTROL 1.0 \(Product Set Manager\)

{% hint style="info" %}
The 8SELECT integration team will adjust the widget styling üé® to your shop design. ‚ù§Ô∏è 
{% endhint %}
